        At ecobee, I was hired as a Software Engineer on the Home Monitoring Backend (HMB) team for 8 months, from January 2024 until August 2024. 
        At HMB I've touched two major product initiatives, led process discussions, executed cloud infrastructure upgrades and even led a sprint!
        This Work Term Report will cover the last 4 months of my ecobee journey, from June 2024 till August 2024.

    <p class="body-text !text-lg" [ngClass]="{ 'dark-mode': darkMode$ | async }">
        Hardware Service Bundles (HWSB) was a major product initiative to sell our security hardware with an included ecobee SmartSecurity subscription.
        For this project, I was in charge of updating the Activation Code state using Google Pub/Sub event handlers in combination with custom client methods for our activation code and subscriptions provider.
        To facilitate better customer engagement metrics, I also enabled Amplitude events on our NextJs front-end, allowing product managers to track user flows 
        and discover any problems in our UX.  
        <br>
        <br>
        This project involved cross-functional collaboration across 8+ plus teams, and I was able to demonstrate my excellent communication skills through
        PRs on other team's Github repositories and though defining tickets and project scope by communicating with project managers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, we sell over 9+ Hardware Service Bundles every day, with lots of potential to grow. Check them out at <a class="text-accent/70" href="https://www.ecobee.com/en-ca/bundles-exclusives/" target="_blank">https://www.ecobee.com/en-ca/bundles-exclusives/</a>

    <h1 class="heading2 !text-2xl underline" [ngClass]="{ 'dark-mode': darkMode$ | async }" id="Third Party Device Integration">Third Party Device Integration</h1>
    <p class="body-text !text-lg" [ngClass]="{ 'dark-mode': darkMode$ | async }">
        Once the dev work for HWSB was complete, me and my team moved on to our next product initiative, integrating a third party device with our smart security ecosystem.
        <br>
        <br>
        As part of the integration, we needed to keep track of the device's complex state using a collection of webhooks from the third party provider. 
        The complexity grew when we found there wasn't perfect parity between the states we need to display to the user and the state we receive from the third party.
        Faced with this problem, I created a state diagram detailing all possible states and how the device can go from one to another, 
        facilitating further discussion and allowing us to identify various edge cases and future challenges.
        <br>
        <br>
        I then implemented support for one of these states, modifying our existing domain, decoder and service layers in our GO domain driven architecture. 
        Part of this implementation involved handling a new webhook payload, which had a field shared by other payloads, but as a different type.
        Unfortunately, this broke our existing decoder design, so I was tasked with designing a workaround. 
        The result was a new decoder that exploited GO's polymorphic capabilities to decode a variety of webhook payloads with minimal configuration.
        <br>
        <br>
        While this integration is still in the works, we expect around 5000 devices to be connected within the first 1-2 months after release.

    <h1 class="heading2 !text-2xl underline" [ngClass]="{ 'dark-mode': darkMode$ | async }" id="SCRUM Lead">SCRUM Lead</h1>
    <p class="body-text !text-lg" [ngClass]="{ 'dark-mode': darkMode$ | async }">
        I've always been inspired by the various SCRUM leads I worked with throughout my internships, so I made it my goal this term to become one myself.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="body-text !text-lg" [ngClass]="{ 'dark-mode': darkMode$ | async }">
        At ecobee, the responsibilities of a SCRUM lead involve:
    </p>
    <ul class="body-text !text-lg" [ngClass]="{ 'dark-mode': darkMode$ | async }">
        <li>Facilitating scope discussion during sprint planning.</li>
        <li>Leading our daily standup meetings.</li>
        <li>Orchestrating sprint retrospectives.</li>
        <li>Delivering updates to upper management and project managers.</li>
        <li>Ensuring the team is on-track and happy.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="body-text !text-lg" [ngClass]="{ 'dark-mode': darkMode$ | async }">
        With help from the current SCRUM master, I slowly took on more responsibility and attended more skip meetings until I was able to lead the entirety of my last sprint!
        In our sprint retro before this one, we had discussed a problem where our Jira epics did not contain all the tickets required to complete the epic requirements. 
        To address this issue, I introduced a new team ritual to audit the epics involved in the next sprint to ensure their completeness. 
        I also encouraged discussion around the definition of completeness to ensure everyone was on the same page.
        <br>
        <br>
        I was also able to use my relative inexperience to my advantage by asking a lot of questions. 
        This allowed more senior team members to challenge their assumptions, forcing us to discover gaps in our process much earlier. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Leading a sprint was an eye opening experience, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to apply the communication and leadership skills I gained thought my minor in Project Management and my previous internships.

    <p class="body-text !text-lg" [ngClass]="{ 'dark-mode': darkMode$ | async }">
        I was simultaneously excited and anxious about my first time doing an end of term co-op presentation. 
        I would be presenting with some of my fellow co-ops in front of all ecobee engineers and engineering managers, discussing my contributions and learnings during my time at ecobee.
        While I only had one day to prepare, I'm extremely proud of what I was able to create in such little time. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I would like to share with you some slides discussing a new concept I had learned, which I've coined "Responsibility Based Error Responding":

    <p class="body-text !text-lg" [ngClass]="{ 'dark-mode': darkMode$ | async }">
        My presentation was praised for it's well thought out analogies, lightheartedness and coherence with the ecobee brand.

    <p class="body-text !text-lg" [ngClass]="{ 'dark-mode': darkMode$ | async }">
        My learning goals for this term were:

        <li>Contribute to the GO codebase.</li>

        <li>Lead a sprint.</li>
    </ul>

        As you can see, I was successful in achieving my goals this term!
